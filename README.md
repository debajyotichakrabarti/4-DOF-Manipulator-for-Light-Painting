# 4-DOF-Manipulator-for-Light-Painting

The objective of the project is to build a robotic manipulator to light paint a given image or text. The report explains the design, implementation, and testing of a 4-DOF robotic manipulator called the Bulb Equipped Artistic Manipulator (BEAM). The system uses four rotary-joint arm with an LED end-effector to trace user-defined paths in three-dimensional space. These paths are captured as glowing text or patterns through long-exposure photography. The manipulatorâ€™s hardware was designed after performing static force analysis and simulations to ensure stability and accuracy. On the software side, the contour extraction algorithm converts user inputs (in terms of text or image) into desired positions and orientations. Further, based on Forward and Inverse Kinematics the joint trajectories are computed for the corresponding goal positions and orientations. Singularities were handled with joint range limits and Damped Least Squares (DLS) methods to ensure smooth motion. MATLAB simulations validated the system at every step, from image processing to final trajectory execution. The manipulator, equipped with Dynamixel MX-28AR motors and tuned PD controllers, successfully reproduced patterns like text and images with clean lines and accurate orientations.
